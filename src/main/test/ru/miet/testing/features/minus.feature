Feature: Sub
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sub of two numbers
	So that I can avoid silly mistakes

@positive @sprint2
Scenario: Subtract two numbers
	Given I have entered first number 50.0 into the calculator
	And I have entered second number 70.0 into the calculator
	When I press minus
	Then the result should be -20.0 on the screen
